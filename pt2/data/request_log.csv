## [Considerations]:
1. Democracy is a term which has lost much of its original meaning.
2. There's a dollar democracy that runs through our supposed democracy.
3. We are a democratic country.
4. The fundamental dynamic of Australian society is that it is one of evolution, not revolution.
5. We live in a great democracy.
6. Our political system's strength is that it can change to meet changing circumstances.
7. The last thing we need is a Canberra 'Big Brother' telling us what we should read and hear.
8. If you want your vote to count for anything, then you need to not vote in ignorance, you need to know something about what you're being offered.
9. In Australia the rich have virtually unlimited access to the legal system and the capacity to use it to achieve their own ends.
10. You don't have to wait three years to say 'I'm not happy with the job you did.' You can apply pressure, and enough people writing to the local member can turn the situation around.
11. I don't think we have a lot of input into legislation and a lot of things that are important.
12. Sometimes I get a bit worried that there's a lot of small minority groups that tend to get a lot of the say
13. I don't know too much about democracy. I feel ridiculous voting.
14. I don't want to be in a place where only a minority's viewpoint gets the right to say what's going to happen.
15. The true believers are about decency in life, about a capacity to debate the issues and to receive different views.
16. We as individuals have a right, that's what democracy means to me
17. Republicanism is a smokescreen for democratic treachery, incompetence and lunacy.
18. Our government is attempting to mould our society to the needs of a profit-oriented market
19. I'm always cynical about government processes.
20. Governments can talk a great game about 'democracy'. They fall down, in practice, because they cannot accept any sharing of the power to influence decisions with those who might have different motives and ideas.
21. I don't think there's anything wrong with people voting for their self-interest.
22. The true function of government is to maintain peace and justice. This does not include interfering in private transactions of its electors.
23. If Australia is to recover from the horrible mess we are in at present, we will need leaders of high principles, who will govern with honesty, justice, and righteousness, fearlessly putting into practice the principles of the Bible.
24. Our community and nation should invoke a spirit that you are important, that you do have a way of influencing things.
25. Until women are equally represented in Australian parliaments, we will not have a genuine representative democracy.
26. I suppose we do have an upper class and a lower class.
27. The only time we are all equal is when we vote in the ballot box.
28. A lot of people may be politically ignorant, but they believe what they see and hear on television, and that makes them vote the way they do. They have been brainwashed by the clever advertising people.
29. Free markets work because individual people, cooperating peacefully and voluntarily through markets, can achieve much that politicians and bureaucrats cannot achieve using compulsion and direction.
30. Low female participation rates compound the domination of the public realm by males.
31. Concluding that some races/cultures are better than others must be avoided.
32. People get the government they deserve
33. There is no real difference in ideological terms between the major parties and preference distributions are problematic.
34. Too few people have a lot of sway in the system.  Corporate lobbyists, vested interests, pork barrelling and contributions to political parties are all problematic.
35. The political system is remote and closed and the connection with elected representatives is difficult, they are often faceless.
36. The party system is the main obstruction to accountable politics.
37. People are quite capable of processing and thinking about the vast majority of issues facing our society but as long as we are subjected to 'news lite' the level of political debate will remain facile.
38. It would be a great thing if voters could vote on specific issues, not only on a whole party program at election time.
39. In the Senate there should be elected representatives who are not from the major parties but from smaller interest groups.
40. We suffer a Parliamentary Democracy and an archaic and conflict oriented, ""two party system"" where one of two main parties will manipulate us for the next few years.
41. The people we elect are loyal not to we dumb bunnies who elected them, but the agenda and dogma of their party.
42. Proportional Representation also forces parties to coalesce and moderates out the extreme political views.
43. We should not be afraid of disagreement. Indeed, an important feature of a liberal democracy is respect for conflicting ideas; difference is part of the human condition.
44. We should strengthen protections of the free press in order to facilitate a more open and publicly accountable government.
45. There is a lot of consultation by govt â€“ but who is listening?  And what power do they have to make changes?
46. Democracy means that all policy is exposed to open discussion and debate in a public political space of all citizens before being put to a transparent, accountable vote.
47. Democracy means we, the people, are responsible for what government does, or fails to do.
48. Not voting is a form of expression. It's a way of telling parties that no one is offering policies that appeal to you.","1. 9

11. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
12. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
13. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
14. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
15. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
16. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
17. We can adapt to the coming changes.
18. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
19. I care about the planet.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
22. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.
23. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
24. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
25. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.

27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
28. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
29. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
30. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
31. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.

## [Considerations]:
1. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
2. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
3. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
4. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
5. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
8. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
9. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
10. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
11. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
12. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
13. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
14. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
15. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
16. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
17. We can adapt to the coming changes.
18. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
19. I care about the planet.
20. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
21. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
22. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries.
23. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
24. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
25. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
26. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
27. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
28. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
29. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
30. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
31. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
32. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
33. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.","1. 11
